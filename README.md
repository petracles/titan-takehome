# IEX App

I want to become a better programmer, so I'm attempting to build out a desktop app that is a tool utilizing [the IEX](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/). This app is built using the following stack:
* ReactJS and some dependencies (client)
* NodeJS and some dependencies (server)
* Electron (desktop)
 
Wish me luck!
